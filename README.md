# anki-weak-tags
Addon for Anki which calculates weakest tags to pay more attention.

Once installed it adds new menu option "`Weakest Tags`"  to  menu  "`Tools`".  When
user click it input box appears with number of  displayed  tags  request.  User
could input any nubber greater or equal to zero. "0" means that all tags should
be count (be careful, if you have too many tags result message box could be too
tall). Any other number will be used as tag scount limit. Default value is `5`.


Then plugin calculates lapses for each tag and show top to user.
