Once your flashcards collection is tagged, you can ask "which tags are my weakest?".

Once installed it adds a new menu option "Weakest Tags" to menu "Tools". When users click it, an input box appears with a request for a number of tags (users can input any number greater or equal to zero).

Then plugin calculates lapses for each tag and shows top tags to the user.

"0" means that all tags would be counted (be careful, if you have too many tags, the result message box would be too tall). Default value is 5.
